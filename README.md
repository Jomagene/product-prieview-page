## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a background blur effect using the ::before pseudo-element, which added a subtle, transparent overlay to images. I also mastered the use of variables in SCSS, making my stylesheets more maintainable and consistent. Additionally, I learned the importance of using relative units like rem and em for better accessibility, ensuring the design adapts well to different devices and user settings.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to explore CSS Grid for complex layouts and delve deeper into SCSS to optimize my styling workflow. I also aim to improve my understanding of accessibility best practices.

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to create a background blur effect using the `::before` pseudo-element, which added a subtle, transparent overlay to images. I also mastered the use of variables in SCSS, making my stylesheets more maintainable and consistent. Additionally, I learned the importance of using relative units like `rem` and `em` for better accessibility, ensuring the design adapts well to different devices and user settings.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I want to explore CSS Grid for complex layouts and delve deeper into SCSS to optimize my styling workflow. I also aim to improve my understanding of accessibility best practices.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Pseudo-elements](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/) - Helped me effectively use `::before` and `::after` in CSS.
- [SCSS Variables](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - The Sass guide was essential in learning to use variables for maintainable styles.
